Potential Users:
Researcher

User Story:  Researcher has obtained a XANES spectra for their sample and now needs to analyze that data to identify oxidation states for the sample.

Researcher provides the elements present?
Researcher queries reference database to compare possible matches to their data
Researcher employs this python package to apply regression and deconvolute their spectra into component peaks

User Story: A researcher wants to expedite the process of collecting XANES spectral information on a material. The researcher will access the program and input a spectrum (experimental or simulated) and receive an output of the minimum number of data points needed to fully reconstruct the spectrum and which energy values the data is to be collected at. The researcher can then quickly collect XANES information at those energy values and reconstruct the entire spectrum without having to collect data at every energy. 


 user stories:
·  Bob is interested in knowing what is his sample the XANES looks like, but to save the cost and fast the process of getting the result, only want to do the limited tests under different energy X-rays. he used our package. He will use this software to choose the possible composition existing in his test example, and K-edge or L-edge he wants a test. He will then receive several potential incident energies that he should use to his example to obtain the XANES and the actual chemical composition quantitatively in a minimum number of tried.
 
·  Lucy has sample which has a short interesting dynamic effect, time is very important, she will use this package, so she won’t miss the things that happen. So she only has to sample several different incident energy rather than the full spectrum.
 
·  Chris wants to section his sample to see how the composition varies spatially. But one section go through all the spectrum will take too long, By using our package to short the time for each section, then he can do mapping
 
project1:

Create XANES and chemical environment  database: 
user stories:

By inputting large amount of computational XANES, one will have corresponding chemical environment. One to one relationship database will be formed.

Having XANES spectrum(computational or experimental), and get the chemical environment directly rather than analysis the spectrum manually.
